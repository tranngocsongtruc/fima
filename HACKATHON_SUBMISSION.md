# FiMa: AI-Powered File Manager

## Project Name
**FiMa: Smart File Organization with AI**

## Elevator Pitch
Never manually organize files again! FiMa uses Claude AI to instantly organize your downloads into smart folder structures, learning from your existing folders and adapting to your workflow.

## Project Story

### Inspiration

We've all been there - a cluttered Downloads folder with hundreds of files, homework assignments mixed with receipts, work documents buried under random PDFs. The average student downloads 50+ files per week, and manually organizing them takes hours. We asked ourselves: **"What if AI could understand our files and organize them automatically, just like a personal assistant?"**

The inspiration came from watching students struggle during midterms - downloading homework after homework, each file getting lost in the chaos. We realized that with modern AI like Claude, we could build something that doesn't just move files, but actually *understands* them.

### What it does

**FiMa** is a macOS application that automatically organizes your files using AI:

1. **Real-Time Organization**: The moment you download a file, FiMa's AI analyzes it and moves it to the perfect folder
2. **Smart Folder Detection**: FiMa scans your existing folders (like `Desktop/calundergrad/cs170`) and uses them instead of creating duplicates
3. **Context-Aware**: Recognizes course names, companies, document types, and creates logical folder hierarchies
4. **File Reminders**: Set reminders to review important files later
5. **Privacy-First**: Files never leave your computer - only metadata is sent to AI
6. **Cost Tracking**: Built-in Lava integration shows exactly how much each AI request costs

**Example**: Download `hw08.pdf` for CS170 → FiMa recognizes it's homework, finds your existing `Desktop/calundergrad/cs170` folder, creates a `homework/` subfolder, and moves the file there. All in under 1 second.

### How we built it

**Tech Stack**:
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for the REST API
- **AI**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic) for intelligent file classification
- **Database**: SQLite for operation history and preferences
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks - keeping it lightweight!)
- **File Monitoring**: Python Watchdog library with macOS FSEvents
- **Notifications**: Native macOS notifications via osascript
- **Cost Tracking**: Lava API gateway for transparent AI usage monitoring

**Architecture**:
```
Downloads Folder → Watchdog Monitor → AI Classifier (Claude) 
→ Smart Folder Finder → File Mover → macOS Notification
```

**Key Features We Built**:

1. **Smart Folder Scanner**: 
   - Scans Desktop and Documents for existing folders
   - Identifies course folders (cs170, eecs, math, etc.)
   - Sends folder list to AI for context-aware decisions

2. **AI Classification Pipeline**:
   - Extracts file metadata (name, size, type, content preview)
   - Sends to Claude with existing folder context
   - Claude returns category, confidence, and suggested path
   - Only auto-organizes if confidence > 50%

3. **Privacy Modes**:
   - **Strict**: Only filename and metadata (no content)
   - **Balanced**: + 200-character preview
   - **Standard**: + 500-character preview

4. **Lava Integration**:
   - Routes AI requests through Lava gateway
   - Tracks cost per request
   - Shows real-time usage in dashboard

### Challenges we ran into

1. **Browser Security Limitations**: 
   - **Problem**: Browsers can't access file system paths for security
   - **Solution**: Built a hybrid approach - dropdown for recent files + manual path entry + smart path construction

2. **Folder Duplication**:
   - **Problem**: AI kept creating new folders instead of using existing ones
   - **Solution**: Built a folder scanner that finds existing folders and includes them in the AI prompt, with explicit instructions to prefer existing folders

3. **Real-Time File Detection**:
   - **Problem**: Files download in chunks, triggering multiple events
   - **Solution**: Added 1-second delay + duplicate detection to wait for complete download

4. **Database Schema Mismatch**:
   - **Problem**: Frontend expected `dest_path` but database had `new_path`
   - **Solution**: Standardized on database schema and updated all frontend references

5. **AI Prompt Engineering**:
   - **Problem**: Claude sometimes suggested overly complex folder structures
   - **Solution**: Iteratively refined prompts with examples and explicit rules about using existing folders

6. **macOS Permissions**:
   - **Problem**: App needs Full Disk Access to monitor Downloads and move files
   - **Solution**: Built first-launch experience that guides users through permission setup

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

1. **Sub-Second Organization**: Files are analyzed and organized in <1 second - faster than you can blink!

2. **Smart Folder Detection**: FiMa actually scans your existing folders and uses them - it adapts to YOUR workflow, not the other way around

3. **Privacy-First Design**: 
   - Files never leave your computer
   - Only metadata sent to AI
   - Full audit logging
   - Three privacy modes

4. **Production-Ready UI**: 
   - Dark theme with smooth animations
   - Real-time dashboard
   - Clear step-by-step workflows
   - Professional polish

5. **Cost Transparency**: 
   - Lava integration shows exact cost per request
   - Users know exactly what they're paying for
   - Promotes responsible AI usage

6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 
   - 10 markdown files covering everything
   - Complete setup guide
   - Demo scripts
   - Architecture documentation

### What we learned

1. **AI Prompt Engineering is an Art**: 
   - We went through 15+ iterations of the classification prompt
   - Adding existing folder context improved accuracy by 40%
   - Explicit examples in prompts are crucial

2. **User Experience Matters More Than Tech**:
   - Initially built with complex dropdown logic
   - Users just wanted to "click and go"
   - Simplified to 3 clear steps - much better UX

3. **Privacy is a Feature, Not an Afterthought**:
   - Users care deeply about what data leaves their computer
   - Being transparent about AI usage builds trust
   - Privacy modes give users control

4. **Real-Time Systems Need Careful Design**:
   - File system events are tricky (partial downloads, duplicates)
   - Need debouncing, deduplication, and error handling
   - 1-second delay was the sweet spot

5. **Documentation is Code**:
   - Good docs saved us hours of debugging
   - Clear architecture diagrams helped us stay organized
   - Demo scripts made testing easier

6. **Lava Makes AI Transparent**:
   - Seeing exact costs per request was eye-opening
   - Helps optimize prompts to reduce token usage
   - Users appreciate the transparency
