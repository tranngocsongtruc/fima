   - Available on GitHub releases
   - No app store needed

2. **Thoughtful UX**
   - Asks for permission properly
   - Respects user's existing organization
   - Supportive, not pushy

3. **AI Intelligence**

## üêõ Backup Plans

### If notification doesn't appear:
- **Say**: "The notification should appear here, but you can see it worked in the web UI"
- Show Recent Operations in web UI

- **Say**: "On first launch, macOS asks for permission - I've already granted it"
- Continue with analysis

### If browser doesn't open:
- Open manually: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- **Say**: "The web dashboard provides a visual interface"

## üí° Questions Judges Might Ask

**Q: How do you handle different file types?**
**A**: Claude AI analyzes file content, name, and context. It recognizes PDFs, images, documents, code files, and more. For PDFs, we extract text for better classification.

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
**A**: Users can toggle monitoring off anytime. All operations are logged and reversible. Plus, the AI learns from your existing organization style.

**Q: How is this different from existing tools?**
**A**: Most tools require manual rules or are cloud-based. We use AI to understand context (like recognizing "CS170" as a course) and work entirely locally for privacy.

**Q: Can it work on Windows/Linux?**
**A**: The backend is cross-platform Python. We're starting with macOS for the native experience, but Windows/Linux support is planned.

**Q: How much does it cost to run?**
**A**: About $0.001 per file with Claude API. For typical usage (50 files/day), that's ~$1.50/month. We're exploring local models to reduce costs.

**Q: Is it open source?**
**A**: Yes! Apache 2.0 license. Code is on GitHub for anyone to audit, modify, or contribute to.
