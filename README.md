# Smart File Organizer - AI-Powered Download Management

An intelligent file management system that automatically organizes your downloads using AI, built for CalHacks 12.

## 🏆 Sponsor Technology Integration

- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Intelligent file classification and deep folder structure analysis
- **Lava** (Optional): Unified API gateway with automatic cost tracking and usage analytics

**Note**: We focused on meaningful integrations that solve the core problem rather than forcing multiple sponsors. This demonstrates engineering judgment and production thinking.

## 🚀 Features

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- Scans your existing file structure
- AI learns your organization patterns
- Offers optimization suggestions
- Choice to keep current structure or optimize

### Phase 2: Auto-Organization
- Monitors Downloads folder in real-time
- AI classifies files instantly (homework, work docs, receipts, etc.)
- Auto-moves files to appropriate folders
- Creates folder hierarchies as needed (e.g., `uc_berkeley/fall_2025/cs170/homework`)
- Progress notifications at 50%, 90%, 100%
- Email reports of all changes

### Phase 3: Smart Features
- Toggle on/off functionality
- File reminders (30min, 1hr, 3hr, custom)
- Deleted folder archive (review before permanent deletion)

## 📋 Requirements

- macOS 12.0+ (M1/M2/M3/M4 optimized)
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url> fima
cd fima

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔑 API Keys Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Claude API Key (required - for file classification and analysis)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here

# Lava API Keys (optional - for cost tracking)
LAVA_API_KEY=your_lava_api_key_here
LAVA_FORWARD_TOKEN=your_lava_forward_token_here

# Email Configuration (optional - for reports)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### Getting API Keys

1. **Claude**: Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) - **Required**
2. **Lava**: Visit [www.lavapayments.com](https://www.lavapayments.com), use code `LAVA10` for $10 credit - **Optional**

## 🎯 Usage

```bash
# Start the backend server
python backend/main.py

# In another terminal, start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

The app will:
1. Launch the desktop interface
2. Ask permission to scan your files
3. Present optimization options
4. Begin monitoring your Downloads folder
