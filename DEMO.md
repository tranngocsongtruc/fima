## üí° Questions Judges Might Ask

**Q: How do you handle different file types?**
**A**: Claude AI analyzes file content, name, and context. Recognizes PDFs, images, documents, code files. For PDFs, we extract text for better classification.

**Q: What if the AI makes a mistake?**
**A**: Users can toggle off anytime. All operations logged and reversible. AI learns from your existing organization.

**Q: How is this different from existing tools?**
**A**: Most tools require manual rules or are cloud-based. We use AI to understand context and work locally for privacy.

**Q: Can it work on Windows/Linux?**
**A**: Backend is cross-platform Python. Starting with macOS for native experience, Windows/Linux support planned.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
**A**: ~$0.001 per file with Claude API. For 50 files/day, that's ~$1.50/month.

**Q: Is it open source?**
**A**: Yes! Apache 2.0 license on GitHub.
