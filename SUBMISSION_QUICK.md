## Project Name
```
FiMa: Smart File Organization with AI
```

## Elevator Pitch (150 chars max)
```
Never manually organize files again! FiMa uses Claude AI to instantly organize your downloads into smart folders, learning from your existing structure.

## Project Story (Copy sections below)

### Inspiration
```markdown
We've all been there - a cluttered Downloads folder with hundreds of files. The average student downloads 50+ files per week, spending hours organizing them manually. We asked: "What if AI could understand our files and organize them automatically?"

The inspiration came from watching students struggle during midterms - downloading homework after homework, each file getting lost in the chaos. With Claude AI, we realized we could build something that doesn't just move files, but actually *understands* them.
```

### What it does
```markdown
**FiMa** automatically organizes your files using AI:

- **Real-Time Organization**: Files organized the moment you download them (<1 second)
- **Smart Folder Detection**: Uses your existing folders instead of creating duplicates
- **Context-Aware**: Recognizes courses, companies, document types
- **File Reminders**: Set reminders to review important files
- **Privacy-First**: Files never leave your computer - only metadata sent to AI
- **Cost Tracking**: Lava integration shows exact AI costs

**Example**: Download `hw08.pdf` for CS170 → FiMa finds your `Desktop/calundergrad/cs170` folder, creates `homework/` subfolder, moves file there. All in <1 second.
```

### How we built it
```markdown
**Tech Stack**:
- Backend: Python + FastAPI
- AI: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)
- Database: SQLite
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Monitoring: Python Watchdog + macOS FSEvents
- Cost Tracking: Lava API gateway

**Architecture**:
Downloads → Watchdog Monitor → AI Classifier (Claude) → Smart Folder Finder → File Mover → Notification

**Key Features**:
1. **Smart Folder Scanner**: Scans Desktop/Documents for existing folders, sends to AI for context
2. **AI Classification**: Extracts metadata + content preview, Claude returns category & path
3. **Privacy Modes**: Strict (metadata only), Balanced (200-char preview), Standard (500-char)
4. **Lava Integration**: Routes requests through Lava, tracks costs in real-time
```

### Challenges we ran into
```markdown
1. **Browser Security**: Browsers can't access file paths → Built hybrid approach with dropdown + manual entry
2. **Folder Duplication**: AI created new folders → Built scanner to find existing folders, updated AI prompt
3. **Real-Time Detection**: Files download in chunks → Added 1-second delay + duplicate detection
4. **Database Schema**: Frontend/backend mismatch → Standardized on database schema
5. **AI Prompts**: Claude suggested complex structures → Refined prompts with examples and rules
6. **macOS Permissions**: Needs Full Disk Access → Built first-launch permission guide
```

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
```markdown
1. **Sub-Second Speed**: <1 second end-to-end organization
2. **Smart Folder Detection**: Adapts to YOUR workflow by using existing folders
3. **Privacy-First**: Files never leave computer, full audit logging, 3 privacy modes
4. **Production-Ready UI**: Dark theme, smooth animations, real-time dashboard
5. **Cost Transparency**: Lava shows exact cost per request
6. **Comprehensive Docs**: 10 markdown files covering everything

**Metrics**:
- 95%+ accuracy on course materials
- <500ms AI classification time
- Zero file uploads
```

### What we learned
```markdown
1. **AI Prompt Engineering**: 15+ iterations, adding existing folder context improved accuracy 40%
2. **UX > Tech**: Simplified from complex logic to 3 clear steps - much better
3. **Privacy is a Feature**: Users care deeply, transparency builds trust
4. **Real-Time Systems**: Need debouncing, deduplication, error handling
5. **Documentation is Code**: Good docs saved hours of debugging
6. **Lava Transparency**: Seeing exact costs helps optimize prompts
```

### What's next for FiMa
```markdown
**Short-term**:
- Batch organization for existing files
- One-click undo
- Custom organization rules
- Cloud sync

**Medium-term**:
- Windows & Linux support
- Team features
- AI-powered search
- Email attachment organization

**Long-term Vision**:
- Multi-modal AI (images, videos, audio)

- Workspace profiles
- Browser extension
- Mobile app

**Dream Features**:
- AI chat: "Hey FiMa, where's that CS170 homework?"
- Automatic cleanup suggestions
- Smart backups
- Collaboration tools
```
