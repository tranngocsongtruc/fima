## 🎨 How AI Works Now

### Smart Folder Detection:
```
1. AI scans your existing folders:
   ✓ Desktop/calundergrad/cs170
   ✓ Desktop/calundergrad/eecs  
   ✓ Documents/work
   
2. You download: hw08.pdf (CS170 homework)

3. AI recognizes: "This is CS170 homework"

4. AI checks: "Does Desktop/calundergrad/cs170 exist?"
   → YES! Use it!

5. AI creates: Desktop/calundergrad/cs170/homework/

6. File goes to: ~/Desktop/calundergrad/cs170/homework/hw08.pdf ✅
```

### Fallback (No Existing Folder):
```
If no existing folder found:
→ Creates: ~/Documents/fima/school/[course]/[category]/
```

---

## 📁 Your File Paths

### CS170 Files:
```
Before: ~/Documents/SmartFileOrganizer/school/current_semester/homework/hw08.pdf
After:  ~/Desktop/calundergrad/cs170/homework/hw08.pdf ✅
```

### Other Course Files:
```
EECS: ~/Desktop/calundergrad/eecs/homework/
Math: ~/Desktop/calundergrad/math/homework/
New course: ~/Documents/fima/school/[course]/homework/
```
