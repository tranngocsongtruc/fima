# ✅ SETUP COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Both Issues Fixed!

### Issue 1: ✅ Old Folder Removed
The `smart-file-organizer` folder has been removed. Everything is now in the `fima` folder (your Git repository).

### Issue 2: ✅ App Now Runs Successfully
Fixed all dependency issues. The app is now running at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Problematic Dependencies
**Problem**: `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` requires Xcode (not just Command Line Tools)

**Solution**: 
- Created `requirements-core.txt` with only essential dependencies
- Updated `ai_classifier.py` to use built-in `mimetypes` instead of `python-magic`
- Made optional modules gracefully handle missing dependencies

### 2. Updated Imports
- Made email reporter optional
- Made database optional  
- Made other non-essential modules optional
- App now runs with minimal dependencies

### 3. Fixed File Type Detection
- Replaced `python-magic` with built-in `mimetypes` module
- No external dependencies needed for MIME type detection

## 📦 Current Dependencies (Minimal)

```
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic
pydantic-settings
anthropic
httpx
watchdog
python-dotenv
requests
python-dateutil
```

**All installed successfully!** ✅

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Direct Python (Recommended for now)
```bash
cd /Users/tructran/Desktop/calundergrad/hackathons/calhack12/fima
python backend/main.py
```

### Option 2: Using start.sh (if you want virtual env)
```bash
cd /Users/tructran/Desktop/calundergrad/hackathons/calhack12/fima
./start.sh
```

**App will be available at**: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## ✅ Verification

The app is currently running and shows:
```
✅ Lava API gateway enabled - cost tracking active
✅ All required API keys are configured
✅ Lava API gateway configured (optional)
✅ Server ready at http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Old Folder
- ✅ `smart-file-organizer` folder has been removed

## 🐛 If You Need More Features

To add email reports or other features:

```bash
# Install additional packages one by one
pip install aiosmtplib
pip install email-validator
pip install sqlalchemy
pip install aiosqlite
```

But the core app works without these!
